## Contrast and Resolution  

---  

## What is contrast?

Contrast describes the separation in intensity between blacks and whites  

---  

## What is Resolution  

Resolution is a measurement of a systems ability to produce object detail  

---  

## Describe Contrast  

Contrast depends on the frequency of changes and intensity between line pairs of black and white

---

## Describe Resolution  

The measure or size of the smallest object that can be detected by the vision system   

---  
## How is Contrast Measured?

Contrast is measured by determining the distace between black and white

---  

How is Resolution Measured?


Resolution is typically quantified in pixels per unit distance (e.g., pixels per millimeter)   


---  

## Resolution and Contrast Work Together   

Resoltion and conrast are closely linked and that connection is described by MTF  

---  

## Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)  
  
MTF is the lenses ability to reproduce contrast at a specific resolution and describes the overall performance of a system

---  

## What is a pixel?

A pixel (picture-element) is the smalled unit or part of an image or display  

---  

## Pixel Resolution  

Pixel resolution is the physical size of an image or represented by the area in pixels in width x height  

---  

## Pixel Size  

Pixel size is usually measured in micrometers (width x height) and impacts light gathering ability  

---  

## Imager Sensor Size  

Imager sensor size is directly related to pixel size and contains a specific amount of pixels

---  

## Image Quality  

The correct resolution for the application with the best possible contrast discerning features  

---  

## Resolution and Contrast Summary  

Resolution and contrast are determined by sensor size in pixels and quality of optics to produce an ideal MTF with available contrast
