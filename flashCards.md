# Machine Vision

Is it a science or an art?

## ?

## Contrast and Resolution  

---  

## What is contrast?

Contrast describes the separation in intensity between blacks and whites  

---  

## What is Resolution  

Resolution is a measurement of a systems ability to produce object detail  

---  

## Describe Contrast  

Contrast depends on the frequency of changes and intensity between line pairs of black and white

---

## Describe Resolution  

The measure or size of the smallest object that can be detected by the vision system   

---  
## How is Contrast Measured?

Contrast is measured by determining the distace between black and white

---  

How is Resolution Measured?


Resolution is typically quantified in pixels per unit distance (e.g., pixels per millimeter)   


---  

## Resolution and Contrast Work Together   

Resoltion and conrast are closely linked and that connection is described by MTF  

---  

## Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)  
  
MTF is the lenses ability to reproduce contrast at a specific resolution and describes the overall performance of a system

---  

## What is a pixel?

A pixel (picture-element) is the smalled unit or part of an image or display  

---  

## Pixel Resolution  

Pixel resolution is the physical size of an image or represented by the area in pixels in width x height  

---  

## Pixel Size  

Pixel size is usually measured in micrometers (width x height) and impacts light gathering ability  

---  

## Imager Sensor Size  

Imager sensor size is directly related to pixel size and contains a specific amount of pixels

---  

## Image Quality  

The correct resolution for the application with the best possible contrast discerning features  

---  

## Resolution and Contrast Summary  

Resolution and contrast are determined by sensor size in pixels and quality of optics to produce an ideal MTF with available contrast  

---  

## Imaging Devices and Components  

Names and descriptions of system devices and componenets  

---  

## Camera  

A camera is a physical device that houses imaging components and mounting hardware that convert captured energy into numeric representation   

---  

## Lens  

A lens determines what the camera "sees" in the real world, provides maginification of a scene,and focuses the collected light onto a sensor

---  

## Sensor  

A sensor converts focused light from the lens into electrical signals for processing  

---  

## Filter  

A filter is a device placed in front of the lens to enhance image quality, improve contrast, reduce glare, and isolate specific wavelengths of light to emphasize certain features of the object being imaged.  

---  

## Field of View  

Field of view is the obserable area by system measured in millimeters (width x height)  

---  

## Angular Field of View  

The angular extent of the observable scene that a camera can capture, measured in degrees.

---  

## Working Distance  

Working distance is the distance between the front of the camera lens and the object being imaged; determined by angular field of view  

---  

## PMAG (Primary magnification)  

PMAG is the degree if magnification and angular field of view stated in millimeters  

---  

## Exposure  

Exposure is the controlled amount of light let into a sensor over a period of time  

---  

## Entocentric Lenses  

Entocentric (endocentric) lenses have perspective with wide angles and shorter working distances with less distortion (fixed focal length; prime)  

---  

## Telecentric Lenses  

Telecentric lenses have a perpendicular view with almost no angle or perspective

---  

## Collimated Light  

Collimated light are rays of light (particles) that are made to be accurately parallel

---  

## Angle of Incidence  

Angle of incidence is the angle that light rays contact a surface relative to the normal perpendicular point
